I am a member of the [Geometry and Mathematical Physics Group](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/maths/research/research-groups-and-centres/geometry-mathematical-physics/) at Loughborough University.

I research Kähler geometry.
I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of Simon Donaldson.
My PhD thesis is available [HERE](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/31373).
